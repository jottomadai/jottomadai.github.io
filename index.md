<br> -my reusable upcycled drink sleeve on Kickstarter is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jotto/shapeshift-upcycled-drink-sleeves-with-an-artsy-twist?ref=1qqc4v">LIVE</a>. I'd love to have your comments/concerns and input! All feedback is valuable and welcomed.

I'm also looking for artists to join in on the kickstarter! You'll even get paid once your design is chosen by a backer, so invite anyone you think would be interested. Plus, you'll be contributing to reducing waste on our beautiful planet, and hopefully, making someone's day a little bit brighter. :)
